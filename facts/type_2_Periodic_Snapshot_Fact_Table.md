## Periodic Snapshot Fact Table: Capturing the Big Picture at Regular Intervals

While transaction fact tables delve into individual events, periodic snapshot fact tables offer a broader perspective. They capture the state of your business **at specific points in time** (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), providing a **summary** of key metrics. 

**Imagine it as a series of photographs:** Each snapshot represents a picture of your business at a particular point in the period. By analyzing these snapshots over time, you can observe trends, identify patterns, and track progress towards goals.

Here's a closer look at periodic snapshot fact tables:

* **Granularity:** Represents a **higher level of aggregation** compared to transaction fact tables. Each row summarizes data for a specific period (e.g., Daily sales figures)
* **Time Dimension:**  Contains a strong connection to the time dimension table, allowing you to analyze trends over time. 
* **Measures:** Stores **quantitative** data points (facts) relevant to the chosen period. These can be sums, averages, or other aggregations of measures from underlying transaction data. (e.g., Total sales for the month, Average customer visits per week)
* **Additivity:** Similar to transaction fact tables, periodic snapshot fact tables ideally contain **additive facts**. You can meaningfully sum the measures across different time periods. (e.g., You can sum monthly sales figures to get quarterly sales)

**Example: Periodic Snapshot Fact Table for Website Traffic**

Imagine an e-commerce website with a data warehouse. The periodic snapshot fact table for website traffic might look like this:

| Column Name | Description |
|---|---|
| Date | Day for which the website traffic data is summarized |
| Page Views | Total number of page views on the website |
| Unique Visitors | Number of unique visitors to the website |
| Average Visit Duration | Average time spent by visitors on the website |
| Top Products Viewed | List of most viewed products for the day |

**Benefits of Periodic Snapshot Fact Tables:**

* **Trend Analysis:** Enables analysis of trends and patterns over time, providing insights into customer behavior and website performance.
* **Performance Monitoring:** Tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) at regular intervals, allowing for continuous monitoring of progress.
* **Improved Query Performance:**  Aggregating data into periodic snapshots improves query performance compared to querying detailed transaction data.
* **Reduced Storage Requirements:**  Stores a smaller volume of data compared to transaction fact tables, reducing storage needs.

Periodic snapshot fact tables are valuable for gaining a high-level overview of business performance over time. They provide a solid foundation for identifying trends, setting benchmarks, and monitoring progress towards strategic goals.
